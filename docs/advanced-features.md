## Parallel Execution

### Concept
Parallel execution allows multiple steps or workflows to run simultaneously, reducing overall execution time for independent tasks.

### Implementation Approach
In conductor, we can implement parallel execution using Bash background processes:

```yaml
# workflows/parallel-example.yaml
name: parallel-tasks
description: Run independent tasks in parallel
steps:
  - name: start-task-a
    command: |
      echo "Task A started"
      sleep 5
      echo "Task A completed"
    async: true
  - name: start-task-b
    command: |
      echo "Task B started"
      sleep 3
      echo "Task B completed"
    async: true
  - name: wait-for-completion
    command: |
      echo "Waiting for all tasks to complete..."
      wait
      echo "All tasks completed"
```

### Enhanced Workflow Schema
To support parallel execution, we extend our workflow schema:

```yaml
name: parallel-workflow
steps:
  - name: parallel-group-1
    type: parallel
    steps:
      - name: task-1
        command: echo "Running task 1"
      - name: task-2
        command: echo "Running task 2"
  - name: sequential-task
    command: echo "This runs after parallel tasks complete"
```

## Chained Workflows

### Concept
Chained workflows allow one workflow to trigger another, creating complex execution pipelines.

### Implementation
We can implement workflow chaining by calling the conductor CLI from within a workflow:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# workflows/chained-workflow.sh

echo "Starting chained workflow execution..."

# Run the first workflow
echo "Executing build workflow..."
conductor run build

# Check if build was successful before continuing
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Build successful, running tests..."
    conductor run test
    
    # Check if tests passed
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Tests passed, deploying..."
        conductor run deploy
    else
        echo "Tests failed, aborting deployment"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Build failed, aborting"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Chained workflow completed"
```

### Workflow Dependencies
We can also define dependencies in workflow metadata:

```yaml
# workflows/deploy.yaml
name: deploy
depends_on:
  - build
  - test
description: Deploy application after successful build and test
steps:
  - name: deploy
    command: ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Conditional Execution

### Concept
Conditional execution allows steps to run only when certain conditions are met.

### Implementation
We can add conditional logic to workflows:

```yaml
# workflows/conditional-example.yaml
name: conditional-workflow
steps:
  - name: check-environment
    command: |
      if [ "$ENV" = "production" ]; then
        echo "production" > /tmp/env.txt
      else
        echo "development" > /tmp/env.txt
      fi
  - name: production-only-task
    condition: '[ "$(cat /tmp/env.txt)" = "production" ]'
    command: echo "Running production-specific task"
  - name: development-only-task
    condition: '[ "$(cat /tmp/env.txt)" = "development" ]'
    command: echo "Running development-specific task"
```

### Enhanced Conditional Syntax
For more complex conditions, we can support expressions:

```yaml
name: advanced-conditional
steps:
  - name: check-disk-space
    command: df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//' > /tmp/disk_usage.txt
  - name: cleanup-if-needed
    condition: '[ $(cat /tmp/disk_usage.txt) -gt 80 ]'
    command: echo "Disk usage is above 80%, running cleanup..."
```

## Loops

### Concept
Loops allow repetitive execution of steps with different parameters.

### Implementation
We can implement loops in shell script workflows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# workflows/loop-example.sh

echo "Starting loop workflow..."

# Loop through a list of servers
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    echo "Processing $server..."
    # Simulate some work
    echo "Running health check on $server"
    # In real implementation, you would do actual work here
    sleep 1
done

echo "Loop workflow completed"
```

### Parameterized Loops
For more complex scenarios, we can define loop parameters in YAML:

```yaml
# workflows/parameterized-loop.yaml
name: parameterized-loop
loop:
  items:
    - { name: "web-server", port: 80 }
    - { name: "api-server", port: 8080 }
    - { name: "db-server", port: 5432 }
steps:
  - name: check-service
    command: |
      echo "Checking {{item.name}} on port {{item.port}}
      # Actual service check would go here
```

## AI Agent Integration

### Concept
AI agents can be integrated to make decisions, generate content, or automate complex tasks within workflows.

### Implementation Approaches

#### 1. External AI Service Calls
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# workflows/ai-integration.sh

echo "Starting AI-integrated workflow..."

# Use AI to analyze logs and detect issues
echo "Analyzing application logs with AI..."
ai_analysis=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze these logs and identify any critical issues: '$(tail -n 20 /var/log/app.log)'"}
    ]
  }' | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')

echo "AI Analysis: $ai_analysis"

# Make decisions based on AI analysis
if echo "$ai_analysis" | grep -q "critical"; then
    echo "Critical issues detected, alerting team..."
    # Send alert
else
    echo "No critical issues found"
fi
```

#### 2. AI-Powered Configuration Generation
```yaml
# workflows/ai-config-generation.yaml
name: ai-config-generation
steps:
  - name: generate-config-with-ai
    command: |
      # Use AI to generate optimal configuration based on environment
      prompt="Generate a Redis configuration optimized for $(nproc) CPU cores and $(free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $2}')MB RAM"
      
      config=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "{
          \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",
          \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"$prompt\"}]
        }" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')
      
      echo "$config" > redis.conf
      echo "AI-generated Redis configuration saved to redis.conf"
```

#### 3. AI-Assisted Troubleshooting
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# workflows/ai-troubleshooting.sh

echo "Starting AI-assisted troubleshooting..."

# Collect system information
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d'%' -f1)
memory_usage=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{printf("%.2f"), $3/$2 * 100.0}')
disk_usage=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

# Create system report
system_report="System Status Report:
CPU Usage: ${cpu_usage}%
Memory Usage: ${memory_usage}%
Disk Usage: ${disk_usage}%
Recent Logs: $(journalctl -n 10)"

# Ask AI for troubleshooting suggestions
troubleshooting=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",
    \"messages\": [
      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Based on this system report, identify potential issues and suggest troubleshooting steps: $system_report\"}
    ]
  }" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')

echo "AI Troubleshooting Suggestions:"
echo "$troubleshooting"
```

## Implementation Examples

### Extended Workflow Engine
To support these advanced features, we need to extend our workflow engine. Here's an example of how we could modify the workflow processor:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# src/advanced-workflow.sh

# Function to execute parallel steps
execute_parallel() {
    local workflow_file="$1"
    
    # Extract parallel steps from workflow
    local parallel_steps=$(jq -r '.steps[] | select(.type=="parallel") | .steps[]' "$workflow_file")
    
    # Execute each step in background
    while IFS= read -r step; do
        local command=$(echo "$step" | jq -r '.command')
        eval "$command" &
    done <<< "$parallel_steps"
    
    # Wait for all background processes to complete
    wait
    echo "All parallel steps completed"
}

# Function to execute conditional steps
execute_conditional() {
    local step="$1"
    
    local condition=$(echo "$step" | jq -r '.condition // empty')
    local command=$(echo "$step" | jq -r '.command')
    
    if [ -n "$condition" ]; then
        if eval "$condition"; then
            eval "$command"
        else
            echo "Condition not met, skipping step"
        fi
    else
        eval "$command"
    fi
}

# Function to execute loops
execute_loop() {
    local workflow_file="$1"
    
    local items=$(jq -r '.loop.items[]' "$workflow_file")
    local steps=$(jq -r '.steps[]' "$workflow_file")
    
    while IFS= read -r item; do
        # Process each step with the current item
        while IFS= read -r step; do
            # Replace placeholders with actual values
            local processed_step=$(echo "$step" | sed "s/{{item.name}}/$(echo "$item" | jq -r '.name')/g" | sed "s/{{item.port}}/$(echo "$item" | jq -r '.port')/g")
            eval "$(echo "$processed_step" | jq -r '.command')"
        done <<< "$steps"
    done <<< "$items"
}
```

### Enhanced CLI Commands
We can also add new CLI commands to support these features:

```bash
# Add to src/cli.sh

# Function to visualize workflow dependencies
visualize_workflow() {
    local workflow_name="$1"
    
    echo "Workflow: $workflow_name"
    echo "Dependencies:"
    
    # Show dependencies if any
    local dependencies=$(jq -r '.depends_on[] // empty' "$WORKFLOWS_DIR/$workflow_name.yaml" 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$dependencies" ]; then
        echo "$dependencies" | while IFS= read -r dep; do
            echo "  └── $dep"
        done
    else
        echo "  └── None"
    fi
}

# Function to validate workflow syntax
validate_workflow_syntax() {
    local workflow_name="$1"
    
    if [ -f "$WORKFLOWS_DIR/$workflow_name.yaml" ]; then
        if command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            if jq empty "$WORKFLOWS_DIR/$workflow_name.yaml" 2>/dev/null; then
                echo "✓ Workflow syntax is valid"
            else
                echo "✗ Workflow syntax is invalid"
                return 1
            fi
        else
            echo "⚠ jq not installed, skipping syntax validation"
        fi
    else
        echo "Workflow not found: $workflow_name"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### New CLI Commands
Add these to the CLI argument parser:

```bash
# Add to parse_args function in src/cli.sh

case "${1:-}" in
    # ... existing cases ...
    
    visualize)
        if [[ -n "${2:-}" ]]; then
            visualize_workflow "$2"
        else
            echo "Error: No workflow specified"
            echo "Usage: conductor visualize <workflow-name>"
            return 1
        fi
        ;;
        
    validate)
        if [[ -n "${2:-}" ]]; then
            validate_workflow_syntax "$2"
        else
            echo "Error: No workflow specified"
            echo "Usage: conductor validate <workflow-name>"
            return 1
        fi
        ;;
        
    # ... existing cases ...
esac
```
